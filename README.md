## Usage 
 This application is built for developers to save code snips and share them if they so choose. The user feed will display code that is set to be shared publicly, and users can also search for public code by defining keywords or languages they are searching for. Private code can also be retrieved from a user's profile page with the same language and keyword parameters. Upvoting is used in the feed to help users identify quality code. Multiple editors are also available to allow users to save snips that may require multiple languages or files. These features are designed to help users find useful code they can copy or reference for their current projects
